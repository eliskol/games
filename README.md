This repository contains programs I wrote as part of the games section of the Eurisko Machine Learning course. See more about this course and learn about the curriculum at [this site](https://eurisko.us).

I have implementations of Connect 4, Snake, and Tic-Tac-Toe in the games folder, and intelligent game agents in their respective game folders.
